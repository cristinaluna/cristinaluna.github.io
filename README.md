## About Me

```c
printf("Hello, GitHub.\n");
```

I'm a Planetary Robotics Project Manager at **GMV Aerospace** and a PhD candidate in Space Anthropology at UNED. I bridge the technical and social dimensions of space exploration through my dual expertise in autonomous robotics systems and ethnographic research on analog missions. My work spans from leading international consortiums developing lunar and planetary rovers to conducting participant observation as an analog astronaut at HI-SEAS.

**Current status:** üî≠ Leading cutting-edge planetary robotics projects while ethnographically documenting how humans prepare to become spacefaring beings.

## PhD Research: *Ensamblajes Gravitacionales: Imaginarios planetarios en una etnograf√≠a de los espacios-tiempos*

**Current PhD (2023-ongoing):** Space Anthropology at UNED, Madrid  
**Supervisors:** Dra. Montserrat Ca√±edo Rodr√≠guez, Dra. Anne W. Johnson

The research topic of my PhD is the ethnographic construction of outer space through analog missions as liminal spaces where terrestrial practices of spacefaring are materially and discursively assembled. My work examines how these simulated environments‚Äîfrom Mars research stations in remote terrestrial locations to underwater habitats mimicking spacecraft conditions‚Äîbecome sites of cultural production where the boundaries between Earth and space, human and technological, real and simulated are continuously negotiated and reconfigured.

I develop the concept of **"ensamblajes gravitacionales"** (gravitational assemblages) to understand how heterogeneous elements‚Äîhumans, technologies, protocols, territories, imaginaries‚Äîattract each other, establish provisional relational orbits, repel, and generate force fields that transcend the sum of their components.

### Key Concepts
- **Ensamblajes Gravitacionales:** Dynamic configurations where heterogeneous elements coexist in productive tension without resolving into synthesis
- **Bremmsstrahlung Social:** Productive deceleration generated by frictions between hegemonic and subaltern space narratives  
- **Cosmog√©nesis Situada:** Active processes of creating habitable cosmos from situated epistemologies of the Global South
- **Place-Making Planetario:** How terrestrial locations become extraterrestrial through analog practices

### Research Focus
- **Analog Mission Ethnography:** Multi-sited fieldwork in Mars simulation facilities
- **Digital Ethnography:** WhatsApp-mediated coordination as decolonial tactical timeline
- **Feminist Space Studies:** How Latin American women create alternative forms of spatial expertise
- **STS Approaches:** Science and Technology Studies perspectives on space exploration from the margins

## A Note on This Website üìù

This site was built with markdown because sometimes the simplest tools are the best tools. Just like how the most profound insights about space exploration often come from paying attention to the most mundane practices of daily life in simulation habitats.

*Currently accepting collaborations, research partnerships, and recommendations for the best freeze-dried ice cream brands.*

*"The anthropologist in space is not looking for aliens‚Äîshe's looking at how humans become alien to themselves through the practices of simulation, preparation, and technological mediation. The real aliens, it turns out, are the space cultures we constructed along the way."*
